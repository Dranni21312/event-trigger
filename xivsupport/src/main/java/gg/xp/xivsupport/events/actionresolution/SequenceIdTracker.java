	// TODO: current main problem with the idea of being able to use ActionEffects to get predicted data faster than
	// waiting for sync: we have to basically redo the entire way we get combatant data, since it looks something like
	// this:
	/*
		Enemy has 10/10 HP
		I snapshot ability that does 2 damage
		Enemy is predicted to have 8/10 HP (still has 10/10 in reality because it hasn't resolved).
		Ability resolves
		In reality enemy has 8/10 HP, but we haven't gotten new HP from WS yet, so 10/10 is shown.
		We get the real numbers on next combatants update, now shows 8/10.

		In other words, rather than seeing 10 > 8, we see 10 > 8 > 10 > 8.

		Two ideas for how to handle this.

		First: The heavy-handed idea.
		ACT lines should be the primary and authoritative source of combatants information.
		WS combatants data should supplement that for the fields for which ACT lines are unreliable or nonexistent
		(ACT lines have all the data, but the data would still be missing in a different way if you start the program
		after zoning in)
		WS combatants data should also be used when we haven't gotten an update for a particular combatant in a while
		(fixes the issue with fflogs replay where downtime mechanics just don't really show movement).

		Unfortunately this definitely has the ability to break stuff, and I'll also need new tests.

		Second: The lightweight idea

		Keep the current system, but also use ACT lines to complement the data from WS.
		I think for now, it would be sufficient to purely use the NetworkActionSync data, and yoink *just* HP from it,
		since NetworkActionSync is what would actually result in a unit's HP going down.
