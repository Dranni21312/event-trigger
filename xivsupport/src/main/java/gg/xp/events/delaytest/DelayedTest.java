/**
 * Example for how to make a "after A, wait X seconds then do Y, unless Z happened in the meantime" kind of trigger
 *
 * This implementation supports the typical usage case for a DoT tracker, though a proper one would track per-enemy.
 * It will do the callout 5 seconds after the most recent invocation, unless cancelled since then.
 * i.e. refreshing the dot will reset the countdown. Cancelling with stop the countdown.
 *
 * The way this is accomplished is by keeping track of our most-recently-submitted DelayedEvent, and simply checking
 * the incoming event against that one. It would probably be more forward-looking to use a field on the event for this,
 * but this example uses == for simplicity. The 'cancel' command simply nulls out the field, so the incoming event
 * will never pass the check.
