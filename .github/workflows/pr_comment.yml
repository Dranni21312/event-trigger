            Once this branch successfully builds, you will be able to try the branch out
            for yourself by changing the "branch" in your updater to ${{ github.head_ref }}.
            This setting can be found under the "Updates" tab.
            
            Don't forget to change back when you are done testing. You should reset your 
            branch either to 'stable' for normal releases, or 'master' for beta builds.
