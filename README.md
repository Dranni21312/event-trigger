# Triggevent

Fully event driven trigger + overlay system for FFXIV.

Makes triggers easier to develop and test.

Allows triggers to have custom configuration GUIs and overlays.

For the technical explanation of why I made this, see [Why](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/wiki/Why-I-Made-This).

## How to Download/Install

READ THIS: See [Installation](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger/wiki/Installation-and-Setup)

Short version: Install Overlayplugin in your ACT, then start OverlayPlugin WSServer from within ACT.

Shows remaining cooldown and active time. 

#### Replay Support

You can import a previous session, or an ACT log. You can even force-on overlays to see what your overlays *would*
have looked like at that point.

To open a replay, simple run triggevent-import.exe instead of triggevent.exe, and then choose a file.
